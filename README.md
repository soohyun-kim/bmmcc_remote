Welcome to the BMMCC remote project!

This little misadventure began after I couldn't resist purchasing a used BMMCC listing I found on eBay for $519 ($995 MSRP).  It was a fair price, I suppose, given the security of buying from a retailer (30 day return and warranty) and the fast and free shipping.  The camera itself was also in excellent condition.

To accompany it I purchased a cheap, open-box gimbal (FeiyuTech G6 Plus) for $140 ($269 MSRP), and a suitable lens (Olympus M.Zuiko 25mm f/1.8) for $164 ($249 MSRP).  Both were excellent prices.

Other accessories were necessary for operation.  An Amazon order consisting of SD Card (Kingston React 128GB), ND filter (Gobe 46mm Variable ND), IR cut filter (ICE 46mm UV IR Cut filter), and LP-E6 battery charger (RAVPower Dual Slot Charger) was placed for $100.60.  

One need still remained: a screen.  For the fun of it, I devised a little project to create a wireless remote device that could receive video feed wirelessly from the camera, whilst also being able to send commands to camera wirelessly as well.  Video would be transmitted via one of those cheap AV transmitters used in automobiles, and the camera commands would be communicated using an xbee, with an Arduino Mini.

In consideration for getting things to work first, however, I am creating a simple video mount atop the camera body that takes in a wired video source.  The wireless capabilities will be implemented later.
